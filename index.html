    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      Young man previously persuing a career in software and front-end web
      development, when a career in the aerospace industry presented itself in
      such a way as was impossible to ignore. Currently reacclimating myself
      with programming, for a potential career shift to something where I can
      make income similar to what I do currently, but with significantly more
      freedom to travel.

            This unfortunately will be brief as I'm contractually not at liberty
            to discuss operations at length. Focus on Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy
            recovery operations, support of Starship program as well. Primary
            objective is offshore recovery of first stage booster and both
            fairings. Booster is processed significantly offshore in preperation
            for reuse, and returns back to Cape Canaveral on our drone ship.
            Fairings are safely recovered, corrosion control is performed, and
            they return back to the cape with us on our recovery vessel.

            As a senior test lead at the leading 3rd party A2LA accredited PQT
            facility for the aerospace industry, this is where I aquired the
            majority of my professional experience. The main function of the lab
            was to design test rigs to simulate various in-flight conditions,
            and aquire data to either "pass" a particular part for a military or
            domestic aircraft, or send it back to R&D, per the scope of its
            specifications for safe operation. Some notable tests included Net
            Positive Suction Head testing for Japanese fighter jet centrifugal
            boost pumps, and Fuel Icing testing for the Trent 1000 and BR700
            Rolls Royce fuel systems. Test types varied from pneumatics,
            hydraulics, dynamics, and fire. Ever wanted to launch a store bought
            chicken out of a pneumatic cannon at the cockpit windshield for a
            Boeing 777? This was the place to do it.
